The generated images are saved in the path /no_backups/s1389/CycleGanResize/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/datasets/mid_imgs/*.jpg, the file names of the images
are exactly the same as labelIds.

The path of labelIds is /data/public/cocostuff/dataset_sis/val_label/*.png

The model is downloaded using torch.hub and then loaded with pretrained model(which is in directory : pretrained_model)
